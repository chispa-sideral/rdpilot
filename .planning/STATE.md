# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** A local AI agent can connect to a remote Windows desktop over RDP and read/inspect a program that is only reachable via RDP — using both screenshots and structured accessibility data, without installing or running the agent itself on the remote machine.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Test Environment

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Test Environment)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-06-04 — Roadmap revised (Phase 1 Test Environment inserted, phases renumbered to 9 total)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack locked: IronRDP 0.14 (Rust) + C# NativeAOT sensor + DVC transport on port 3389
- DVC channel (RDPILOT_SENSOR) must be registered before connector.connect() completes — hard IronRDP constraint
- RemoteDesktop_SuppressWhenMinimized=2 is a Phase 2 prerequisite, baked into Phase 1 VM provisioning
- Force 96 DPI on remote session; sensor sets DPI_AWARENESS_CONTEXT_PER_MONITOR_AWARE_V2; emit both coordinate spaces
- v1 done = scripted harness proves end-to-end, no live LLM required
- Phase 1 provisions the Azure Windows target that all subsequent phases test against; auto-destroy prevents runaway cost

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 5: AV/EDR environment on target is unknown — sensor binary hardening level TBD
- Phase 5: Drive redirection GPO policy on target is unknown — WinRM fallback may be required
- Phase 7/9: Target application UIA fidelity is unknown — identify and test before Phase 9 harness assertion design
- Phase 5: NativeAOT binary size unknown — benchmark during Phase 5 (5-30+ MB range)
